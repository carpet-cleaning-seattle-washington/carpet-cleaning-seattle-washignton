                             <p>If necessary, move furniture - Before the carpet cleaners arrive, you should decide if your furniture needs to be moved. Some companies prefer that you leave your rooms empty, while others charge a fee to move your furniture. Others recommend cleaning around your furniture to avoid drying time.</p>

                             <p>Highlights. If you would like to tip your carpet cleaner, $10-20 is a reasonable amount. Carpet cleaners are paid an hourly wage for their services. Some carpet cleaning companies won&#39;t allow employees to tip.</p>

                             <p>Recently, we were asked if professional carpet cleaners must be tipped. Tipping isn&#39;t expected or required in our industry, but it&#39;s appreciated.</p>
