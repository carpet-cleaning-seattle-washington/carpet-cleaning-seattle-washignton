Living in Washington and Seattle means that you can watch the weather change, as well as all of the outside elements creeping into your house. Even though we focus our intentions on cleaning daily or weekly, all homes need to be cleaned from time to time. Most carpet owners have a vacuum. However, vacuums as well as consumer grade steamers are not able to reach the carpet's deep fibres. You will enjoy a cleaner carpet and make your guests feel more at ease. Carpet that you've spent a lot on. This can help increase the value of your house and make it more affordable.

                             <p>Stanley Steemer Odor out Plus - This product uses natural bacterial enzyme activity to digest organic smells like urine. This removes the odor from the source, rather than masking it by fragrances. The enzyme also works in conjunction with a pairing agent, which provides immediate relief from any odors as the enzyme is working within the carpet.</p>
